Challenge 1b ‚Äì Persona-Based Multi-Collection PDF Analyzer

This project is a submission for **Challenge 1b** of the **Adobe India Hackathon 2025**. It presents an advanced solution that extracts and ranks relevant content from multiple PDF document collections using persona-based context. The solution is designed to run **offline**, within resource limits, and produces structured JSON output conforming to expected schema.

---

 Problem Statement

Given a set of collections, each containing multiple PDFs, and an input JSON specifying a **persona** and a **job-to-be-done**, the solution must:

- Parse all PDFs in the collection
- Extract relevant content sections
- Rank sections based on relevance to the persona and task
- Refine these into subsections
- Output a structured JSON result with metadata, section ranks, and extracted text

---

## üß† Approach

The pipeline follows this structure:

1. **Input Parsing**  
   - Load persona and task from `challenge1b_input.json`.

2. **PDF Processing**  
   - Extract text per page using `PyMuPDF`.
   - Identify content-rich sections for ranking.

3. **Relevance Ranking**  
   - Use custom scoring logic (offline) to match sections against the persona-task context.
   - No internet or external APIs/models are used at runtime.

4. **Refined Subsection Generation**  
   - The most relevant pages are truncated or chunked to extract meaningful insights.
   - Summarized text is added to the final output.

5. **Output Generation**  
   - A JSON file `challenge1b_output.json` is created with:
     - Metadata
     - Ranked sections
     - Refined text excerpts
